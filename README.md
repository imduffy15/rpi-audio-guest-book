# RPI Audio Guest Book

This is designed to run on an RPI which has GPIO pins connected to the on/off hook of a telephone and has a USB auto interface that is connected to the telephones speaker and mic.

Currently the code doesn't do this, instead pressing spacebar simulates on/off hook.

## Requirements

 - ffmpeg
 - mplayer

Install these via your favourite package manager e.g. `brew install ffmpeg mplayer`
